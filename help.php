                <h2>Cutomized Playlists</h2>
                <p>Playlists are like mixtapes you create on Playlists. You can share them, subscribe to them, and collaborate on them with your friends.The many playlists MusiX makes just for you, such as Discover Weekly and Release Radar, are based on your listening habits -- what you like, share, save, even what you skip -- as well as those of people with similar tastes.We personalize some of these playlists, so you might see slightly different track listings to someone else. For example, if a playlist has ‘sing-along hits’ we’ll include songs you’d actually know the words to!</p>

                <h2>Weekly Benefits</h2>
                <p>Wonder how you'll find new music? Every week MusiX builds a playlist for you of tracks based on your taste but that you may have never heard before! Discover Weekly is a playlist of songs we think you’ll love. Based on what you and those with similar music tastes listen to, it gets even better the more you use MusiX. Discover Weekly automatically refreshes every Monday, so make sure you save the tracks you like from it before it updates.</p>
